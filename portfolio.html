     </div>
        <p>In our first theme of the semester, we learned about a wide array of
          layout principles, but most importantly, we were introduced to the basics of HTML
          and how to properly style in CSS in order to code our first mobile website.
          Basic image processing (Photoshop) and vector drawing (Illustrator) also involved
          a great part of this project.</p>

            class="button">01.04.01. Responsive Website</button>
     </div>
        <p>Having done our basic mobile website earlier on, we were now being introduced to the basics
          of making a website responsive, thus both for mobile and desktop screens.
          <br><br>We covered basic web design from research and ideation to design and development for the web.
          Considering I had never coded before, it was an incredible achievement for myself to have been able to
          build a website like this one.</p>

        <h2>Basic Animation</h2>

                class="button">02.01.02. Simple Animations</button>
                <p>The first task assigned to us was one of simple animations, where we were
                  expected to showcase our basic knowldge in CSS, but most importantly JavaScript. <br><br>I had quite a lot of
                  difficulties with this, since JavaScript seemed quite overwhelming when one
                  is still trying to get comfortable with writing in HTML and CSS language.
                  However, this was a great way of learning from my own mistakes, especially
                  throughout the next few assignments which were required in this theme.</p>
                <br>
                <button onclick="window.location.href='http://meganelndn.com/KEA/Portfolio%20links/Basic%20Animation/02.02.01%20Week%20submission%20/Week_Submission.pdf'"
                class="button">02.02.01 Week Submission</button>
                <p>In the week submission, we were asked to develop a short story whilst using characters
                  we had created in Adobe Illustrators - featuring a protagonist and an antagonist.
                  Our main focus was to target dramaturgical elements that characterize storytelling as such.
                  <br><br>This task was one of the most challenging in my opinion considering the amount of effort and
                  thinking it required even though I really learned how to use Illustrator with this assignment and
                  actually feel comfortable using it in future projects.</p>
                <br>

                class="button">02.04.06 Final Interactive Production</button>
                <p>The goal in this group project was for us to consolidate the basics we had learned in code and
                  illustrations up until that point in time and with that, create a digital, interactive poster for
                  a movie with game like user interactions. The sender was Cinemateket - the most prominent part of
                  the Danish Film Institute’s public film house.<br><br>My main role within this group was the illustrations
                  of the characters, since I felt very at easy with using Illustrator, as well as creating content for our
                  storyboard and how the story itself should develop with our target audience clearly in mind.</p>
                <br>

                class="button">02.04.07 Presentation</button>
                <p>The presentation was coupled with the above task and required us to address what and how we had
                  been working as a group and to demonstrate our animation in front of our fellow students, the
                  final interactive production. <br><br>Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the presentation due to
                  illness on that day, however, I was the one in charge of designing the PDF document for my group to present.</p>

               <h4>Concept development using video, dramaturgy, film language and media elements.</h4>
               <br>
                      <p>The task was to film a video in collaboration with Kobenhavn Kommune that would
                      highlight the rules of biking in Copenhagen for non-Danes. This task was divided into several
                      smaller sub-tasks. <br><br>Due to absence during the three weeks of this theme, I did not have the possibility to deliver what
                      I was supposed to since I had no group to collaborate with when I got back to classes.
                      This does not work in my favour since I did not get to showcase any skills within the "Basic Content" theme.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Design Sprint was a five day process as a group: We were challenged with the task of delivering
                  an improved version of our learning management portal "Fronter". The main objective was
                  to make it mobile-friendly and refining it in terms of user experience. With this in mind,
                  we were to identify the uses of, problems with and potential solutions for it and create an
                  XD Prototype. <br><br>The brainstorming and sketching part of the Design Sprint took us a lot
                  more iterations than expected, but we had a very good group chemistry, making it all the easier
                  to work together and discuss these iterations constructively. Everyone took part in making the
                  XD Prototype.</p>

                class="button">04.02.01. Web Prototype</button>
                <p>As a continuation of the last project, we then had to code our own, as well
                  as an improved version of our previous XD Prototype based on the test results of students and users
                  we interviewed.<br><br>This project was a little trickier since it was an individual assignment and required
                  a lot of work, at least on my end. However, codewise, I believe it was a good preparation for the final
                  portfolio project. Through this assignment I managed to learn many new things in CSS which have turned
                  out incredibly helpful now.</p>

                class="button">04.03.01. Design Sprint: Native app</button>
                <p>As another group work project, the main goal here was to create an XD Prototype of any app
                  that could make students' lives easier, while providing great user experience to them.
                  Together with my group, we decided it would be a smart idea to create an app for
                  Global Welcome Week to facilitate the arrival of students at our University.<br><br>Here I experienced
                  some very poor teamwork, I'm afraid. Even though we were originally seven people to make a high-fidelity prototype,
                  one of my classmates and I were left completely alone to design and make the prototype work. This is why I am extremely proud
                  of what we achieved in such a small amount of time. It turned out to get very good feedback from others because we both have
                  a very similar taste in design and worked extremely well together.</p>
